## What is REPL

In node.js, REPL stands for: READ, EVAL, PRINT & LOOP.
It's basically a shell where you can run node.js commands, see results and code javascirpt without creating a file first.

**How it Works**
1. READ-> Takes input
2. EVAL-> Evaluates the code
3. PRINT-> Prints the result
4. LOOP-> Goes back to waiting for next command
